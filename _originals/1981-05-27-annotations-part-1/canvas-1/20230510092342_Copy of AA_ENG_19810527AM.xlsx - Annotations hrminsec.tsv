Let’s listen to his witness account about the repression.	Interview
0:28:49	0:28:59	(The attack) happened because the FMLN forces had taken the villa (El Rosario), and they said that they were going to go in to where the Torola police had entered first.	Interview
0:29:02	0:29:20	They killed whoever they caught there. They killed nineteen, among them children and the elderly just because they were refugees and others from the same town they had them on a list to kill, but among the nineteen that they killed were children, elderly people, and women that were nursing.	Casualties/Violence against children
0:29:22	0:29:32	And there, around five days later was the story in the newspaper about a confrontation in El Rosario Villa where nineteen guerrillas had died and that (the army) had not suffered any casualties.	Political context
0:29:33	0:29:33	And this was in what month? 	Interviewer
0:29:34	0:29:56	In January. And I said to myself, “Fuck, that’s how they’re lying to these people.” And I said, “and here I am, one of them, being an accomplice to these huge massacres.” That’s when I became convinced that it was very true. Of course, the huge massacres that they commit are in front of us.	Interview
0:29:57	30:05:00	So, in Villa El Rosario the army assassinated nineteen people, and then they made it seem as if they were--	Interviewer
0:30:06	0:30:16	As guerrillas, and since they were elderly, children, and nursing women, that's were I was convinced, when I realized what we were burying.  	Interview
0:30:16	0:30:18	Do you remember any of the names of the dead?	Interviewer
0:30:19	0:30:22	Yes, only one, his name was Federico Marquez. He was from the center (of town).	Interview
0:30:23	0:30:24	But you saw the bodies?	Interviewer
0:30:25	0:30:40	Yes, I saw them. One had his teeth out, others were beheaded, which is how they assassinated Federico; a machete wound in the back of the neck they gave him, and they left him half-alive, and he had to finish dying on his own. Then, well, there was this officer, too, and he was stationed there. 	Interview
0:30:41	0:30:41	What was his name?	Interviewer
0:30:42	0:30:42	His name was Grande García.	Interview
0:30:43	0:30:45	Grande García.	Interviewer
0:30:46	0:31:19	Yes, of course. There was a huge loss of control with that particular police officer from Torola because he was already there, see? And he already knew everyone (in the town). So then, Liutenant Grande, Mr. Quito, and that one that returned told them of Torola, “Fuck, you guys,” he said, “you’re all massacaring people, and how,” he said, “are we going win?” he said. “What? You must be a subversive,” they told him. “Sure,” he said to them, “If I’m a subversive,” he said to them, “here’s my equipment and everything,” he said, “kill me.”  	Interview
0:31:21	0:31:43	Right now, it’s a weakness that they have. Some of them like to massacre (people), and other are at this moment on the people’s side, and maybe they’re there because of the salary or because of some obligation that they have with high command, or the high commanders put them there.  	Interview
0:31:43	0:31:50	So, you're saying there's a contradiction in the army itself. There's officers and soldiers that are conscious of the massacres.	Interviewer
0:31:51	0:32:37	There are some that do not agree with going around massacring the people, and others that do (agree). I would make a calling to all of those officers, cadets--I was a sergent--liutenants, second liutenants, that I have known them, that they are not assassins, that they do come for the people, that they should leave those ranks, that they should join our people, that they will be received well here.  And it’s not just anyone who’s telling you this, but it’s someone who has sone it, and who is seeing it, and who has lived through it, and I’ve surrendered here, and I have served as a witness as the best comrade-- 	Interview
0:32:38	0:33:06	I feel very happy to be here because they had us deceived, and although they say they’re winning, that the revolutionary forces are made up by two or three and that they’re losing. That’s how they have many people deceived. It’s when one becomes aware that one can no longer be deceived, and if there are any deceived I want it to be clear, stop letting them deceive you. Our people will never lose.	Interview

0:34:03	0:34:20	These are the words of a young Salvadoran who held the weapons the dictatorship gave him and who today bears the weapons of the people. It is a reflection of what is happening in the middle of the Armed Forces. 	Political context
0:34:21	0:35:11	It’s the awakening awareness of those who belong to the exploited classes and who have remained deceived by the criminal high military command, those who have been recruited by force or out of necessity have remained in the army and at the service of the oppresion. Those peasant soldiers have begun to open their eyes, have begun to question the trenches they have occupied. They have begun to ask themselves, “Why do I fight?” “Who do I serve?” “For whom am I sacrificing my own life?”	Political context
0:35:11	0:35:58	In Jucuaran, department of Usulután, soldiers of the third brigade refused to fight against the forces of the Farabundo Marti for National Liberation Front. In Torola, five police of the tax office (Hacienda) abandoned their their posts with their issued weapon and equipment. The same thing is happening in the entire country. Soldiers who have become aware of the misery that they’ve since their roots, (they’ve also become aware) of the repression which they themselves have executed as blind instruments of the oligarchical power and of imperialistic designs.	Political context
0:35:59	0:36:22	Soldiers have their own combat post with their own people, and those who have made that decision and have joined our ranks have been well received, by their brethren of class, with the respect and brotherhood that all have come to know. 	Political context
0:36:24	0:37:04	We showed this recently in the case of soldier Santos Enrique Diaz Alvarenga, the third brigade of San Miguel. And now we have just heard the testimony of Santiago Argueta Sanchez, a former civil guard in Villa del Rosario. In this town when our forces too the enemy’s possession’s, Santiago Argueta Sanches deposed his weapons in response to our combatants’ calls (to join their ranks), and he laid down his weapons and joined our forces.	Political context
0:37:05	0:37:38	He immediately expressed his sincere and conscientious desire to join the ranks of the people, and the statements that he has declared to us reiterate what we all already know, that in the National Army there are profound challenges between the military high command and officers, classes, and soldiers that are do not agree with the genocide.  	Political context
0:37:39	0:38:04	On the other hand, to make these challenges even more acute, within the National Army young officers most likely cannot  how Yankee military adviser the day to day take over the lion’s share of the military operations agains the people, thus giving it everyday a more criminal nature.	Political context
0:38:05	0:38:44	The case of the soldiers that disobeyed the order to fight against the opposition forces of the Farabundo Marti for National Liberation Front, that is to say, the opposition forces of the people, moves us to encouraging reflections on what is happening in the center of the army, in addition to the fact that they’ve been unable to garner any military victory in all their operatives against our positions in the entire national territory. 	Political context
0:38:45	0:39:13	While this is all happening, the people are joining the militias, they are joining their (own) army, they are integrating into the cornfields of the people to produce the sustenance for the revolutionary army. They consolidate the zones under their control while the dictatorship lives its worse moment.  	Political context
0:39:14	0:39:51	Each day, the people is becoming more convinced that victory is within the reach of their united and persevering hands. Hope overwhelms us all, and that is why we close our fists, and we are achieving victory with combat blows.
