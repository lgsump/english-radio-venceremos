0:08:54	0:09:10	Next we present an interesting interview between journalist Gregory Seltzer and Pierre Schori, International Secretary of Sweden’s Socialdemocratic Party.	Interviewee	Schori
0:09:11	0:09:18	(music)	Music	
0:09:19	0:09:27	We would be interested in knowing what is the present state of the pending process for a political solution for El Salvador.	Journalist	Seltzer
0:09:29	0:09:52	In Central America, I held conversations with President Jose Lopez Portillo, President Luis Herrera Campins, Napoleon Duarte, General Omar Torrijos, Commander Fidel Castro, and Guillermo Ungo of the Revolutionary Democratic Front.	Interviewee	Schori
0:09:53	0:10:17	Of course, the result of a concrete and detailed proposal from the Revolutionary Democratic Front and the Farabundo Marti for the National Liberation Front to the regime of Duarte--I cannot go into details for obvious reasons. It is something that needs to be managed by those directly involved.	Interviewee	Schori
0:10:18	0:10:19	Tell us what is possible to share.	Journalist	Seltzer
0:10:21	0:11:03	As of now, there is no positive response. The reality is that a viable solution was rejected by the United States and the Salvadoran administration. The conclusion I deduce from that is that only is there a clear desire to reach a political solution from the opposition, but there has been a method to reach this process. This method, this proposal continues to be valid and supported by the opposition, but of course, that cannot be the only thing.	Interviewee	Schori
0:11:04	0:11:27	On the other hand, another conclusion is that the only obstacle to ending this Salvadoran terror is the negative attitude towards the negotiating process on behalf of the United States and the military, the latter whose opinions differ from Washington’s.	Interviewee	Schori
0:11:29	0:11:43	We are reproducing an important interview of Pierre Schori, the International Secretary of Sweden’s Socialdemocrat party carried out by the journalist Gregory Seltzer.	Radio Venceremos	
0:11:44	0:12:00	To what do we owe that reluctant, resistant, and contrary position of the United States and the Democratic Christian military junta? What’s the expectation that harbors the purpose of this attitude?	Journalist	Seltzer
0:12:02	0:12:34	You can only guess in these types of situations. It would seem that they are trying to weaken as soon as possible the democratic opposition. That’s why they’re sending in weapons in innumerable quantities, weapons that are really not needed in El Salvador. At the same time, they’re trying to deceive world public opinion with the promise of the next elections.	Interviewee	Schori
0:12:35	0:13:11	This is absurd, to talk about elections when there’s a civil war and a war of liberation going on, elections in this country where the list of death row inmates includes the most important leaders of the opposition. Negotiations need to begin before the celebration of elections because otherwise the votes will be cast in the cemeteries.	Interviewee	Schori
0:13:12	0:13:32	Taking into consideration that you were in Honduras a few days ago and the information that flows towards Europe, you mentioned the great number of weapons that the United States sends. Is there an increase in the number of North American military consultants?	Journalist	Seltzer
0:13:34	0:14:19	There is and that’s very important. They say there are 54, which is a great number when compared to the number of officers in the Salvadoran Army, which is 500. That’s more than 10%, but it can also be noted that the North American military presence has a brutalizing effect. I noticed that. According to Honduras, for example, the attitude of the Honduran army on the border with El Salvador has hardened with the arrival of those consultants, according to Honduras.	Interviewee	Schori
0:14:20	0:15:06	What was the result of the process by Mr. Wischnewski in that region? Did it succeed or fail? We ask because, according to statements by newspapers like the New York Times and the Washington Post, Duarte as well as North American government authorities showed Mr. Wischenwsky a document attributed to the Revolutionary Democratic Front and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front which states that the process of politics and peace talks is nothing but a way to buy time with the objective of improving personal conditions at the negotiating table.	Journalist	Seltzer
0:15:07	0:15:59	That’s why Mr. Wischnewski should have made more trips and established more contacts to qualify that situation and the conclusion he reached. In Amsterdam he met with the European socialdemocratic parties and discussed what is an honest, very clear, and valid proposal. This document, according to what they say, is an option among many in a different time, but the proposal Mr. Ungo presents is the one that counts, and it’s the one we recognize as authentically from the Revolutionary Democratic Front y from the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.	Interviewee	Schori
0:16:00	0:16:04	What changed in the situation? Is it a strategic change?	Journalist	Seltzer
0:16:06	0:16:19	The Revolutionary Democratic Front and the Farabundon Marti National Liberation Front are committed to a clear and well-defined project.	Interviewee	Schori
0:16:21	0:16:48	Regarding the April 30th meeting European Socialdemocracy in Amsterdam, there was a unanimous acknowledgement of the Salvadoran situation. Was there a consensus regarding the processes in favor of a political solution as suggested by a certain news outlet, did someone side with the European or Latinamerican Christian democracies?	Journalist	Seltzer
0:16:49	0:17:34	No, on the contrary. There is unanimity inside the International Socialists in their solidarity and fraternal support towards the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) as a member of the International Socialists and the Revolutionary Democratic Front, and we were completely unanimous in the condemnation of the United States’s militaristic policy, and in condemning the military aid and the obstruction to the negotiating process. We continue to propose a political solution, a negotiated solution.	Interviewee	Schori
0:17:35	0:17:56	Why this dedication? Many observers have noticed the European Social Democracy’s interest in Central America. Before now it was Nicaragua, now it’s El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. Would you like to comment on this?	Journalist	Seltzer
0:17:57	0:18:32	Yes, it’s true that we are criticized for dedicating so much of our time to Central America. We are asked why we don’t worry as much about Afghanistan. Our response is that we want to avoid another Afghanistan in El Salvador, another Vietnam. There is a possibility of accomplishing that by mobilizing public international opinion and that of the United States.	Interviewee	Schori
0:18:33	0:19:22	I also want to comment that the election of François Mitterrand has reinforced even further the position of the International Socialists because the French Socialist Party has a very clear political project in regard to Latin America. The very President François Mitterrand has personal ties with many democratic Latin American leaders. Likewise, he was with Salvador Allende and he knows Guillermo Ungo very well. I think that Mitterrand’s election is very important for any weight that France might exercise on Latin American issues.	Interviewee	Schori

There’s a comrade that is going to explain to us, he’s going to describe what we’re seeing here. This really is one of the most macabre scenes that we’ve seen in our lives.

0:23:13	0:23:42	We repeat, the scenes that we are seeing at this moment show us the genocidal character of the high military command.

0:23:54	0:24:05	We found it right here next to the bed. I suspect that they took her from the bed to kill her and to do who knows what else they did to her, probably raped her, because we found her remains next to the bed.	Rape	El_Junquillo

0:39:42	0:41:00	Here is our first information. The university counsels of the United States consider the necessity of not inviting government official to the graduation ceremonies or any other activities to prevent them from having bad experiences. <br> On Saturday, May 23rd, in several universities of the country, the advisor to the president, Secretary of State Alexander Hair and a US ambassador to the United Nations, were targets of student protests for their Yankee foreign policy, particularly the policy pertaining to El Salvador. President Advisor Erwin Leub, was invited to speak at the Law School at the University of San Ysidro, California. He was interrupted when a hundred students from outside the auditorium shouted, “No to the draft! No to the War! Get out of El Salvador!”<br> More information when we reunite without militias on the ground.	Internacional	USA

Later, they will travel to Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. The concerts have proven the European people’s solidarity with our people’s struggle and the rejection of the United States' intervention in El Salvador’s internal issues.	International	Tepehuani

A large concentration of hundreds of North American citizens with hundreds of representatives from Black, juvenile, and other union organizations protested in this city against the racist terror in Atlanta under the slogan, “Save our people. Put an end to racist murders, protect our Atlanta youth, and No to the Salvadoran junta.”	International	USA
0:43:23	0:43:39	While the United States states help the Salvadoran junta, it neglects the North American people to the extent that it permits racists and neo-fascists to wander freely throughout the North American territory.	International	USA
